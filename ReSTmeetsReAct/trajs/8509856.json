This is largely due to the commercial strength of domestic productions, which accounted for 44.5% of admissions in 2014 (35.5% in 2015; 35.3% in 2016).[6] The French film industry is closer to being entirely self-sufficient than any other country in Europe, recovering around 80\u201390% of costs from revenues generated in the domestic market alone.[7].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Ethel Houvier's French voice of a film actress]", "search[American film actress]", "search[French voice of a film]", "search[film actress]", "search[American film actress]", "search[French voice actress]", "search[film French]", "finish[]"], ["search[Mexican and American film actress]", "search[French voice of a film]", "search[French voice of a film]", "search[Mexican film]", "search[film French voice]", "search[French voice actress]", "search[French film]"], ["search[Mexican and American film actress]", "search[American film actress]", "search[French voice]", "search[film]", "search[French film]", "search[American film French voice]", "search[French film]"], ["search[Mexican and American film actress who is the French voice of a film]", "search[French voice of a film]", "search[French voice of a film]", "search[film actress French voice]", "search[American film actress known for a film with a French voice]", "search[French voice actress]", "search[French film]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search for the film actress who is the French voice of a specific actress, find the film actress who is the French voice of the actress, and the answer is the film actress who the French voice of the actress.", "I will search \"American film actress\" instead of \"Mexican and American film actress\" and find who the film actress is.

Von Trier co-created the avant-garde filmmaking movement Dogme 95 alongside fellow director Thomas Vinterberg and co-founded the Danish film production company Zentropa,[13][14] the films from which have sold more than 350\u00a0million tickets and garnered eight Academy Award nominations.. Von Trier has been the subject of criticisms and controversies. Cannes Film Festival, in addition to awarding his films on numerous occasions, once listed him as persona non grata for making a Nazism joke during an interview; animal harm on Manderlay's set, and graphic violence and unsimulated sex in some of his films have drawn criticism; and he has been accused of mistreatment and negligence towards actresses during the filming process, including Bj\u00f6rk.[15][16][17].", "Could not find The Kingdom (1994 film).
