They have also competed in I-League 2nd Division[10][11] during the 2013\u201314 season.[12][13] They won the league by defeating Bhawanipore in the last match of the league and qualified to play for the 2014\u201315 season of the I-League.[14][15][16]. Founded in 1946 as Wahingdoh Sports Club,[17][18] the club based in Shillong,[19] won numerous titles. However, with changing times and professionalisation, the amateur club began to face some amount of difficulty competing with younger clubs and it was then, that the decline began.. In 2007, Wahingdoh Sports Club was almost relegated to the 2nd Division League and as a result of inconsistent performance, the Wahingdoh community felt the need for a younger and more innovative approach.[20] In 2008, the club turned professional when it merged with Royal Football Club before being renamed Royal Wahingdoh FC under the able leadership of the club's owner Dominic Sutnga Tariang.[21] With the club witnessing several dramatic changes, a new chapter was in the making and in the very same year, the club bounced back to claim Third spot in the 2nd Division Regional League, a sign that brought hope for a brighter future.[22] In the First Division 2009 season, they created a record by winning all their games besides scoring 52 goals en route to lifting the title and along with it, an entry into the top tier of Meghalaya football, the Shillong Premier League.[22].", "Could not find Shillong population 2011 census.

While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century.[2][3][4] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O\u2019Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of The Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work.

Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.

His songs for the group include \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry.. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the film Help![3] He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\".", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Dark Horse (album)]", "search[George Harrison]", "finish[Dark Horse tour]"], ["search[Dark Horse (album)]", "search[George Harrison]", "finish[Dark Horse tour]"], ["search[The Beatles Dark Horse]", "search[George Harrison]", "finish[Dark Horse tour]"], ["search[Dark Horse (album)]", "search[George Harrison]", "finish[Dark Horse tour]"]], "thoughts": [["The Beatles did not release Dark Horse, Dark Horse is a album by George Harrison.

Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Jonci\u00e8res, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set.

Largely preserved under the ash, Pompeii offers a unique snapshot of Roman life, frozen at the moment it was buried,[1] as well as insight into ancient urban planning.[2][3] It was a wealthy town of 10,000 to 20,000 residents at the time it was destroyed.[4] It hosted many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and artworks, which were the main attractions for early excavators; subsequent excavations have found hundreds of private homes and businesses reflecting various architectural styles and social classes, as well as numerous public buildings. Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were interred in the ash; their eventual decay allowed archaeologists to create moulds of figures in their final moments of life.

Born to a Jewish family,[2] Senreich graduated from Herricks High School in New Hyde Park, New York.[citation needed]. In 1996, Senreich was employed by Wizard Entertainment, gradually rising to become its editorial director.[3] In 1996 or 1997, Senreich met Green when the actor, a fan of Wizard magazine, responded enthusiastically to an interview request.[4] With Green, Senreich created in 2000 and 2001 Sweet J Presents, a web-based series of animated shorts presented on screenblast.com. Adult Swim contracted the Robot Chicken series on the basis of these shorts.[3]. Senreich and Green together run the production company Stoopid Monkey.[3] His Emmy nominations were shared with other key members of the  production staff of Robot Chicken, including partner Seth Green, for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[5] Senreich received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program (shared with key members of his production staff) at the 62nd annual Emmy Award ceremony held on August 29, 2010.[6].", "Robot Chicken is an American adult stop motion-animated sketch comedy television series created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim.

Robot Chicken has won two Annie Awards and six Emmy Awards.[3][4]. Robot Chicken was conceptually preceded by \"Twisted ToyFare Theatre\", a humorous photo comic strip appearing in ToyFare: The Toy Magazine.[5] Matthew Senreich, an editor for ToyFare, got in touch with actor Seth Green when the former learned that the latter had made action figures of castmates from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and asked to photograph them.[6] Months later, Green asked Senreich to collaborate on an animated short for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, featuring toy versions of himself and O'Brien.[6] This led to the 12-episode stop-motion series Sweet J Presents on the Sony website Screenblast.com in 2001.[6] Conan O'Brien is voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane in the first episode (\"Conan's Big Fun\").[6][7].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "finish[Seth Green]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "finish[Seth Green]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "finish[Seth Green]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "finish[Seth Green]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search Matthew Senreich and Zeb Wells comedy, find the star of the comedy, then find their birth date.", "I need to find the star of the Matthew Senreich and Zeb Wells comedy.

It tells the story of a prolonged feud between two stage magicians in late 1800s England. Its structure is that of a collection of diaries that were kept by the protagonists and later collated. The title derives from the novel's fictional practice of stage illusions having three parts: the setup, the performance, and the prestige (effect).[1].

Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture\u00a0and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. In 1965, the group released its debut studio album, The Wailing Wailers, which included the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search James Hetfield and Bob Marley, find what they are, then find what they have in common.", "James Hetfield is a musician.
