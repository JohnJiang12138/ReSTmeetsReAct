A parody of the superhero genre, Megaton Man is a gigantically-muscled but dim-witted oaf who starred in Simpson's cheerfully absurd stories.[1]. Megaton Man is also the title of the creator-owned comic book series (published by Kitchen Sink Press beginning in 1984) Simpson wrote and drew, in which the character first appeared and starred. The original Megaton Man series ran for ten issues, but the character was later revived in a limited series, The Return of Megaton Man, and a series of one-shot issues spun off from the concept.. In 1994, Simpson left Kitchen Sink to form his own company, Fiasco Comics, through which Simpson self-published his new title Bizarre Heroes, featuring Megaton Man (and many members of his old supporting cast) as part of a large ensemble cast.", "Evidently... John Cooper Clarke is a 2012 television documentary about the life of the Salford performance poet John Cooper Clarke. It was directed by John Ross and produced by Scotty Clark and was first aired on BBC Four in May 2012 as part of BBC Four and BBC 6 Music's \"Punk Britannia\" season. It features testimonies from Bill Bailey, Pete Shelley, Paul Farley, Steve Coogan, Mark Radcliffe, Craig Charles,[1] Plan B, Kate Nash, Alex Turner, Miranda Sawyer and Paul Morley;[2] and poems by Clarke including \"Things Are Gonna Get Worse\", \"Evidently Chickentown\", \"Twat\" and \"Beasley Street\".[1]. John Crace, writing for The Guardian, described the documentary as \"a film that dealt in myths rather than reality\" but assessed Clarke as \"still clever, funny and relevant.\"[3] Mark Monahan in The Daily Telegraph wrote that the programme \"veered too close to comfort towards hagiography\" but \"was nevertheless perhaps a fair reflection of the affection with which [Clarke] has been widely regarded.\"[4].", "Megaton Man (Trent Phloog) is a satirical superhero created by cartoonist Don Simpson.

The first civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. The second war lasted until October 23, 2020, when all parties agreed to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations.[6]. The crisis in Libya has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups.[7][8].", "Could not find Libyan Civil War title.

Often considered to be one of the greatest songwriters in history,[4][5][6] Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60-year career. He rose to prominence in the 1960s, when his songs \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. Initially modeling his style on Woody Guthrie's folk songs,[7] Robert Johnson's blues,[8] and what he called the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams's country songs,[9] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\".[4] His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the decade's burgeoning counterculture.[10]. Dylan was born and raised in St.", "\"When the Levee Breaks\" is a country blues song written and first recorded by Memphis Minnie and  Kansas Joe McCoy in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.. \"When the Levee Breaks\" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin as the last song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics and the songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1]  Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song.. When blues musical duo Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie wrote \"When the Levee Breaks\", the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was still fresh in people's memories.[2]  The flooding affected 26,000 square miles of the Mississippi Delta\u00a0\u2013 hundreds were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate.[3]  The event is the subject of several blues songs, the most popular being \"Backwater Blues\" by Bessie Smith (1927) and \"Mississippi Heavy Water Blues\" by Barbecue Bob (1928).[4].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Bob Dylan]", "search[When the Levee Breaks]", "finish[Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy]"], ["search[Bob Dylan]\nObservation 1", "search[When the Levee Breaks]", "finish[Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy]"], ["search[Bob Dylan]\nObservation 1", "search[When the Levee Breaks]", "finish[Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy]"], ["search[Bob Dylan]", "search[When the Levee Breaks]", "finish[Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy]"]], "thoughts": [["Bob Dylan wrote the song \"High Water\" about the 1927 Louisiana Flood, and wrote another song about the same event, \"When the Levee Breaks\".

Conrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others,[note 4] though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism.[9] His narrative style and anti-heroic characters, as in Lord Jim, for example,[10] have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.[note 5]. Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Poland\u2014during nearly all his life, parcelled out among three occupying empires[16][note 6]\u2014and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world\u2014including imperialism and colonialism\u2014and that profoundly explore the human psyche.[18].", "Episode finished, reward = 1\n"], "actions": [["search[ Polish-British novelist]", "search[The Nigger of the \"Narcissus\"]", "finish[Joseph Conrad]"], ["search[ Polish-British novelist]", "search[Joseph Conrad]", "finish[Joseph Conrad]"], ["search[ Polish-British novelist]", "search[Joseph Conrad]", "finish[Joseph Conrad]"], ["search[ Polish-British novelist]", "search[The Nigger of the \"Narcissus\"]", "finish[Joseph Conrad]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search a Polish-British novelist and find the novella it is a counter narrative to.

Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Jonci\u00e8res, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set.

Largely preserved under the ash, Pompeii offers a unique snapshot of Roman life, frozen at the moment it was buried,[1] as well as insight into ancient urban planning.[2][3] It was a wealthy town of 10,000 to 20,000 residents at the time it was destroyed.[4] It hosted many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and artworks, which were the main attractions for early excavators; subsequent excavations have found hundreds of private homes and businesses reflecting various architectural styles and social classes, as well as numerous public buildings. Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were interred in the ash; their eventual decay allowed archaeologists to create moulds of figures in their final moments of life.

Three days after the jury found her guilty of murder, they sentenced Sald\u00edvar to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 30 years, meaning she will become eligible for parole on March 30, 2025.. Sald\u00edvar was born on September 19, 1960, in San Antonio, Texas. She is one of seven children born to Frank and Juanita Sald\u00edvar.[4]. Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was a fan of country music.[5] After attending one of Selena's concerts, she began repeatedly calling Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, about starting a fan club in San Antonio.[6] Quintanilla eventually gave in to Sald\u00edvar's requests and she immediately became the club's president.[7].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Selena]", "search[Yolanda Saldivar]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[Selena]", "search[Yolanda Saldivar]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[Selena]", "search[Yolanda Saldivar]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[Rob (American TV series)]", "search[Yolanda Saldivar]", "finish[yes]"]], "thoughts": [["Selena is a 1997 American biographical film about the life and career of Tejano singer Selena.

He was one of the foremost artists of the surrealist, avant-garde, and Dadaist movements and an influential figure in early 20th century art.[1] The National Observer suggested that, \"of the artistic generation whose daring gave birth to Twentieth Century Art, Cocteau came closest to being a Renaissance man.\"[2].. He is best known for his novels Le Grand \u00c9cart (1923), Le Livre blanc (1928), and Les Enfants Terribles (1929); the stage plays La Voix Humaine (1930), La Machine Infernale (1934), Les Parents terribles (1938), La Machine \u00e0 \u00e9crire (1941), and L'Aigle \u00e0 deux t\u00eates (1946); and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946), Orpheus (1950), and Testament of Orpheus (1960), which alongside Blood of a Poet and Orpheus constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as \"one of [the] avant-garde's most successful and influential filmmakers\" by AllMovie.[3] Cocteau, according to Annette Insdorf, \"left behind a body of work unequalled for its variety of artistic expression.\"[2]. Though his body of work encompassed many different mediums, Cocteau insisted on calling himself a poet, classifying the great variety of his works \u2013 poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films \u2013 as \"po\u00e9sie\", \"po\u00e9sie de roman\", \"po\u00e9sie de th\u00eaatre\", \"po\u00e9sie critique\", \"po\u00e9sie graphique\" and \"po\u00e9sie cin\u00e9matographique\".[4].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[1991 Disney film]\nObservation 1", "search[1946 French romantic fantasy film]", "search[Jean Cocteau]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[1991 Disney film]", "search[1946 French romantic fantasy film]", "search[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[1991 Disney film]\nObservation 1", "search[1946 French romantic fantasy film]", "search[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[1991 Disney film]\nObservation 1", "search[1946 French romantic fantasy film directed by Jean Cocteau]", "search[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)]", "finish[yes]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search 1991 Disney film and 1946 French romantic fantasy film directed by Jean Cocteau.

Despite attracting positive reviews at the time, the film was a commercial failure in Australia, in part due to scant marketing by United Artists, as well as controversy surrounding its portrayal of outback life, including a hunting scene in which real kangaroos are shot and killed..

He influenced many artists, including Buddy Holly,[3] Elvis Presley,[4] the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,[5] the Animals, George Thorogood, Syd Barrett,[6] and the Clash.[7]. His use of African rhythms and a signature beat, a simple five-accent hambone rhythm, is a cornerstone of hip hop, rock, and pop music.[5][8][9] In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Blues Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2017.[10][8][11] He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[12] Diddley is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his use of tremolo and reverb effects to enhance the sound of his distinctive rectangular-shaped guitars.[13][14]. Bo Diddley was born in McComb, Mississippi,[nb 1] as Ellas Otha Bates (also stated as Otha Ellas Bates or Elias Otha Bates).[16] He was the only child of Ethel Wilson, a  sharecropper's teenaged daughter, and Eugene Bates,[17] whom he never knew. Wilson was only sixteen, and being unable to support a family, she gave her cousin, Gussie McDaniel,[18] permission to raise her son.[15] McDaniel eventually adopted him, and he assumed her surname.[19] Diddley denied ever having the name \"Otha\" in a 2001 interview, saying \"I don't know where they got that 'Otha' from\",[20] but his web site, maintained by his estate, confirms it as his middle name..", "The Yardbirds are an English rock band, formed in London in 1963. The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton (1963\u20131965), Jeff Beck (1965\u20131966) and Jimmy Page (1966\u20131968), all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 greatest guitarists.[5] The band's other members during 1963\u20131968 were vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja, and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, with Dreja switching to bass when Samwell-Smith departed in 1966. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".. Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks,[6] the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock, and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends.[7][6] Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and Page formed Led Zeppelin.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Bo Diddley]", "search[The Yardbirds]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[Bo Diddley]", "search[The Yardbirds]\nObservation 2", "finish[yes]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the assumption that the search results are provided in the same order as the Thoughts.
