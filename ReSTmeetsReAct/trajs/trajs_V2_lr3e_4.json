The construction took place under the supervision of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, until he rebelled against William and was executed in 1076.[1] Stone for the new buildings was cut from the cliffs below the walls and moved up using winches.[2].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Bamburgh Castle]", "search[northeast coast of England castles]", "search[Bodiam Castle]", "search[Dunstanburgh Castle]", "finish[Bodiam Castle, Durham Castle]"], ["search[Bamburgh Castle]", "search[northeast coast of England castles]", "search[Bodiam Castle]", "search[Dunstanburgh Castle]", "finish[Bodiam Castle, Durham Castle]"], ["search[Bamburgh Castle]", "search[northeast coast of England castles]", "search[Bodiam Castle]", "search[Durham Castle]", "finish[Bodiam Castle, Durham Castle]"], ["search[Bamburgh Castle]", "search[northeast coast of England castles]", "finish[Bamburgh Castle, Bodiam Castle]", "search[ other castles located on the northeast coast of England]", "finish[Bodiam Castle and Durham Castle]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search Bamburgh Castle and find its location, then search other castles located on the northeast coast of England.", "Bamburgh Castle is located on the northeast coast of England.
