Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture\u00a0and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[Both James Hetfield and Bob Marley are musicians.]"], "steps": 3, "answer": "Both James Hetfield and Bob Marley are musicians.", "gt_answer": "musician, singer, and songwriter", "question_idx": 565, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0.16666666666666666}, {"observations": ["Question: What type of group does Roses Are Red and Sleeping with Sirens have in common?", "Could not find Roses Are Red group.

The similar term pseudokhristos or \"false Christ\" is also found in the Gospels.[3] In Matthew (chapter 24) and Mark (chapter 13), Jesus alerts his disciples not to be deceived by the false prophets, who will claim themselves to be the Christ, performing \"great signs and wonders\".[4][5][6] Three other images often associated with the Antichrist are the \"little horn\" in Daniel's final vision, the \"man of sin\" in Paul the Apostle's Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, and the Beast of the Sea in the Book of Revelation.[7][8][9]. Antichrist is translated from the combination of two ancient Greek words \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af + \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (anti + Christos). In Greek, \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 means \"anointed one\" and the word Christ derives from it.[10] \"\u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\" means not only anti in the sense of \"against\" and \"opposite of\", but also \"in place of\".[11][12].
