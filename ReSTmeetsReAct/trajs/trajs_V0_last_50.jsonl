He was raised by an aunt, and later by foster parents.[6] He attended the Mount Hermon School for Boys (later Northfield Mount Hermon) graduating in 1937, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a B.A. in journalism in 1941.", "Luigi Pirandello (Italian: [lu\u02c8i\u02d0d\u0292i piran\u02c8d\u025bllo]; 28 June 1867 \u2013 10 December 1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays.[1] He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his bold and ingenious revival of dramatic and scenic art\" [2] Pirandello's works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd..
