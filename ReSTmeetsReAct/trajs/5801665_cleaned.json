The series was moved to TBS in 2014 and continues to air new episodes to this day.[2][3] American Dad! is the first television series made to premiere on Fox's Animation Domination block.[4] The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.[5][6]. Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[7] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes,[3] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[2] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[3] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[3]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.",

Hoodoo Gurus had a string of pop-rock singles including \"Leilani\" (1982), \"Tojo\" (1983), \"My Girl\" (1983), \"I Want You Back\" (1984), \"Bittersweet\", \"Like Wow \u2013 Wipeout\" (1985), and \"What's My Scene?\" (1987).[4] After touring the United States from 1984 onward they gained popularity on the U.S. college rock circuit with the singles \"Come Anytime\" (1989)[6] reaching no.\u00a01 and \"Miss Freelove '69\" (1991)[7] reaching No.\u00a03 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.[8] The Hoodoo Gurus' biggest Australian single was their 1987 top-3 song \"What's My Scene?\".[9] The song was parodied for the National Rugby League 2000s theme \"That's My Team\".[10][11]. The Hoodoo Gurus were inducted into the Australia's 2007 ARIA Hall of Fame.[12][13] The band's induction announcement stated that the Gurus were one of the most \"inventive, lyrically smart and exciting\" bands from Australia.[14] From 1960s power pop and garage punk to hard rock and funky psychedelic kitsch, the group's music stood out from Sydney's Detroit-inspired bands.[4]. Originally formed under the Hoodoo Gurus name in Perth late 1970s.",

It is in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in  west-central Nepal. Manaslu means \"mountain of the spirit\" and the word is derived from the Sanskrit word manasa, meaning \"intellect\" or \"soul\". Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before Nepali Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, \"just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain\".[4][5].",

Shispare lies east of the Batura Wall, which is the highest part of the Batura Muztagh in Pakistan. Notable neighbouring peaks include Pasu Sar to the northwest, Bojohagur Duanasir, Ultar, Hunza Peak and Ladyfinger Peak, which comprise the most southeasterly of the major groups of the Batura Muztagh.

Flanked by Manaslu to the north and Himalchuli to the southeast, Ngadi Chuli is the middlemost and third-highest mountain of the massif. Though shorter and somewhat rounder than its immediate neighbors when viewed from the more common eastern approaches, it is difficult to access due to snow danger and being flanked by active glaciers in all directions. The steep western side, recessed behind outlying peaks and glacial valleys, rises over 3,200 metres (10,500\u00a0ft) above the Thulagi glacier.",

            "Royal Wahingdoh Football Club (also known as Wahingdoh Sports Club)[2] was an Indian professional football club based in Shillong, Meghalaya.[3][4][5] Nicknamed \"Royals\",[6] the club participated in I-League, then top flight of Indian football league system.[7][6] Royal Wahingdoh holds the record for the highest number of consecutive Shillong Premier League titles, having won the finals in December 2010, 2011 and in 2012.[8][9]. They have also competed in I-League 2nd Division[10][11] during the 2013\u201314 season.[12][13] They won the league by defeating Bhawanipore in the last match of the league and qualified to play for the 2014\u201315 season of the I-League.[14][15][16]. Founded in 1946 as Wahingdoh Sports Club,[17][18] the club based in Shillong,[19] won numerous titles. However, with changing times and professionalisation, the amateur club began to face some amount of difficulty competing with younger clubs and it was then, that the decline began.. In 2007, Wahingdoh Sports Club was almost relegated to the 2nd Division League and as a result of inconsistent performance, the Wahingdoh community felt the need for a younger and more innovative approach.[20] In 2008, the club turned professional when it merged with Royal Football Club before being renamed Royal Wahingdoh FC under the able leadership of the club's owner Dominic Sutnga Tariang.[21] With the club witnessing several dramatic changes, a new chapter was in the making and in the very same year, the club bounced back to claim Third spot in the 2nd Division Regional League, a sign that brought hope for a brighter future.[22] In the First Division 2009 season, they created a record by winning all their games besides scoring 52 goals en route to lifting the title and along with it, an entry into the top tier of Meghalaya football, the Shillong Premier League.[22].",

            "Hafiz Rashid Khan is a postcolonialist writer, poet, author, editor, journalist, and Adibaasi researcher. His literary philosophy mostly comes from the practice of Neo-colonialism. To fully understand the schools of thought drawn from in his academic discipline, we need to explore postcolonialism and Neo-colonialism further.\n",
            "Since the direct lookup for postcolonialism did not yield any relevant results, I will try to provide a brief explanation of postcolonialism as it pertains to Hafiz Rashid Khan's academic discipline. Postcolonialism is a critical theory that analyzes, explains, and responds to the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. It often focuses on the power dynamics between the colonizer and the colonized, and how these dynamics shape cultural, political, and social realities.\n\nGiven Hafiz Rashid Khan's work as a postcolonialist writer and researcher, it is likely that his academic discipline draws from schools of thought that criticize and analyze colonial legacies, such as postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory. These schools of thought emphasize the importance of understanding and addressing the lasting impacts of colonialism on colonized peoples and their cultures.\n\nTherefore, while Hafiz Rashid Khan's work may be primarily influenced by Neo-colonialism, it also likely draws from broader schools of thought that are concerned with analyzing and responding to colonial legacies.\n",
            "Apologies for the confusion in the previous answer. It seems there was an error in providing the final answer. While Hafiz Rashid Khan's work is influenced by postcolonialism, the specific schools of thought drawn from in his academic discipline may not be limited to postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory. These are certainly relevant and influential schools of thought in the broader postcolonial conversation, but Hafiz Rashid Khan's work may also draw from other specific theoretical frameworks or academic traditions.\n\nTo accurately answer the question, we would need more detailed information about Hafiz Rashid Khan's academic background, research interests, and the specific context of his work. However, based on the available information, we can tentatively suggest that his academic discipline may draw from a range of schools of thought related to postcolonialism, including but not limited to postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory.\n"

He was required to work exclusively on studio-based films after heart trouble in 1959, one of which, A Summer Place, was a huge commercial success.. Daves worked with some of the best known players of his time including established stars like Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Glenn Ford, James Stewart and Richard Widmark. He also helped to develop the careers of up-and-coming players such as Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Felicia Farr and George C. Scott..",

His films combine fantasy, realism, and science fiction to create idealized realities or to give relevance to mundane situations.. Jeunet debuted as a director with the acclaimed 1991 black comedy Delicatessen, collaborating with Marc Caro. Jeunet then co-wrote and -directed with Caro again on The City of Lost Children (1995). His work with science fiction and horror led him to direct Alien Resurrection (1997), the fourth film in the Alien film series and his first and thus far only experience with an American film.",

The Kansas Jayhawks and the Missouri Tigers began playing each other in 1891. From 1907 to 2012 both schools were in the same athletic conference and competed annually in all sports. Sports Illustrated described the rivalry as the oldest (Division I) rivalry west of the Mississippi River in 2011,[3] but went dormant after Missouri departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference on July 1, 2012. Despite Missouri wanting to continue athletic competition, no further regular season games were scheduled between the two schools for several years.[4] However, the two schools played an exhibition game in men's basketball on October 22, 2017, with Kansas defeating Missouri 93\u201387.",

In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Fr\u012bja, in Langobardic as Fr\u0113a, in Old English as Fr\u012bg, in Old Frisian as Fr\u012ba, and in Old Saxon as Fr\u012b, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijj\u014d. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hl\u00edn, Gn\u00e1, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity J\u00f6r\u00f0 (Old Norse: 'Earth').",

While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century.[2][3][4] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O\u2019Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of The Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work.

Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.",

It was first published in the Beirut journal Hiw\u00e2r. The main concern of the novel is with the impact of British colonialism and European modernity on rural African societies in general and Sudanese culture and identity in particular.[1] His novel reflects the conflicts of modern Sudan and depicts the brutal history of European colonialism as shaping the reality of contemporary Sudanese society. Damascus-based Arab Literary Academy named it one of the best novels in Arabic of the twentieth century. Mawsim al-Hijrah il\u00e2 al-Sham\u00e2l is considered to be an important turning point in the development of postcolonial narratives that focus on the encounter between East and West.[1].",

(Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera Julien, describing the artist's aspirations.) Musically the work is considered an example of verismo, and marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera..

Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Jonci\u00e8res, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set.

In 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated from New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, respectively, leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchise (and only one team overall, the American League's Yankees). Two years later, on July 27, 1959, attorney William Shea announced the formation of a third major baseball league, the Continental League.[1] He tried to get several existing clubs to move, including the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, but no National League club was interested in doing so.[2][3]. One of the Continental League's five charter members was a team in New York City.[1] Majority interest was held by Joan Whitney Payson and Charles Shipman Payson, former minority owners of the Giants.",

In 1977, Carew was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award for his involvement in local community affairs.

Robot Chicken has won two Annie Awards and six Emmy Awards.[3][4].

Because of the name and location, it is frequently confused with Golden Gate National Cemetery, a few miles south of the city..

The cemetery is one of only four officially existing within San Francisco city limits (the others being the Columbarium of San Francisco, the historic graveyard next to Mission Dolores, and the sarcophagus of Thomas Starr King)..

It also contains a deeper contemplation on the nature of fear and courage. While essentially a guide book, there are three main sections: Hemingway's work, pictures, and a glossary of terms.. Hemingway became a bullfighting aficionado  after seeing the Pamplona Festival of San Ferm\u00edn in the 1920s. He wrote about the tradition in the novel The Sun Also Rises.[1] In Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway explores the metaphysics of bullfighting\u2014the ritualized, almost religious practice\u2014that he considered analogous to the writer's search for meaning and the essence of life.",

Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture\u00a0and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.",

Surge was advertised as having a more \"hardcore\" edge, much like Mountain Dew's advertising at the time, in an attempt to lure customers away from Pepsi. It was originally launched in Norway as Urge in 1996, and was so popular that it was released in the United States as Surge in 1997. Lagging sales caused production to be ended in 2003 for most markets.[1]. However, popular fan bases such as Facebook's \"SURGE Movement\" led Coca-Cola to re-release the soft drink on September 15, 2014, for the US market via Amazon Prime in 12-packs of 16-US-fluid-ounce (470\u00a0mL) cans.[2] Following a test-market for the beverage in the Southeastern United States in early 2015, Surge was re-released primarily in convenience stores in the Eastern United States and some Mountain states in September 2015.[citation needed] Surge was re-released internationally in September 2018 in Burger King restaurants in the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines..",

He was the son of organist Cristoforo Benvenuti and studied at the Liceo Musicale (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini) in Bologna under Luigi Torchi (musicology) and Marco Enrico Bossi (organ).[1] In 1919 his collection of songs for voice and piano accompaniment, Canti a una voce\u00a0: con accompagnamento di pianoforte, was published in Bologna.[2] In 1922 he published a collection of 17th-century art songs entitled 35 Arie di vari autori del secolo XVII. Composer Samuel Barber studied the works of Giulio Caccini, Andrea Falconieri, and other early Italian composers under his tutelage in Milan in 1933\u20131934.[3] For the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma he adapted Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo for a production which premiered on 27 December 1934.[4] The adaptation was later used for the first recording of L'Orfeo in 1939,[5] which included a performance by the orchestra of La Scala Milan under conductor Ferrucio Calusio.[6][7].

Born in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c.\u20091590\u20131613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics..

            "A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or more human occupants, and sometimes various companion animals. It is a fully- or semi-sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.[vague] Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing.. Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.[1] The aspect of 'home' can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.. The concept of 'home' has been researched and theorized across disciplines \u2013 topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics.[2] The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.[citation needed] The concept and experience encompasses the likes of exile, yearning, belonging, homesickness and homelessness.[3].

The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting silent film.. The 1970s saw the advent of consumer camcorders that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively inexpensive videocassette which also had audio and did not need to be developed the way film did. This was followed by digital video cameras that recorded to flash memory, and most recently smartphones with video recording capability, made the creation of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person..",

Described as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s,\" Talking Heads helped to pioneer new wave music by combining elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with an anxious, clean-cut image.[6]. Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth met as freshmen at the Rhode Island School of Design, where Byrne and Frantz were part of a band called the Artistics.[1]:\u200a24\u200a The trio moved to New York City in 1975, adopted the name Talking Heads, joined the New York punk scene, and recruited Harrison to round out the band.. Their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, was released in 1977 to positive reviews.[8] They collaborated with the British producer Brian Eno on the acclaimed albums More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980), which blended their art school sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti.[6] From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones..

It was originally published by News Corporation, and it became the property of Hachette Filipacchi in 1995.[5][7] Known as a smart women's magazine, it suffered in comparison to Elle, a more lighthearted issue from the same publisher.[5] Declining ad revenue contributed to a reported $9 million loss in 1999, and the magazine folded immediately after the debut of Oprah Winfrey's magazine O in April 2000.[5]. Mirabella's circulation stood at 558,009 at the time of its demise.[5]. In the Family Guy episode \"Fore, Father\", Stewie Griffin picks up the December issue of Mirabella in the doctor's waiting room..

Bill Cosby is not a widely recognized name, and it's possible that the question is referring to Bill Cosby as a misspelling of Bill Cosby's real name, Bill Cosby Jr., or perhaps a reference to comedian Bill Cosby, who is known for his stand-up comedy and acting career, but not specifically for music albums. However, if we assume that \"Bill Cosby\" is a musician and the question is referring to his third album, we need more information to answer the question.\n\nSince we don't have the exact name of the album or the hotel and casino, we can't directly search for those. Instead, we might try searching for information about Bill Cosby's musical career or discography to see if we can find any clues about where his third album might have been recorded.\n",
            "It appears that the search for \"Bill Cosby\" as a musician has not yielded any relevant results. This suggests that either the name is incorrect or Bill Cosby is not widely known as a musician. Given the lack of information on Bill Cosby's musical career and discography, it is challenging to determine the location of the hotel and casino where his third album was supposedly recorded.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the question might have meant \"Bill Cosby\" as a reference to the comedian and actor Bill Cosby, we could explore the possibility that the album mentioned might be a comedy album or a soundtrack album related to his work. In that case, we could search for information on Bill Cosby's comedy albums or film soundtracks.\n",

            "It appears that there is some confusion regarding the name \"Bill Cosby.\" As mentioned earlier, the correct name is likely Bill Cosby, a well-known comedian, actor, and producer. However, even with the corrected name, there is still uncertainty about whether he has a third album specifically attributed to him as a musician. It's possible that the question is referring to one of his comedy albums or a soundtrack album related to his work.\n\nSince we don't have clear information about a third musical album by Bill Cosby, let's try searching for his comedy albums or film soundtracks to see if we can find any relevant information.\n",
            "It seems that there might be a fundamental misunderstanding in the original question. Bill Cosby, as we know, is a comedian, actor, and producer, but he is not widely recognized as a musician with multiple albums. Therefore, the reference to his \"third album\" is likely incorrect or misleading.\n\nGiven the lack of clarity and the apparent confusion in the question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding the location of the hotel and casino where Bill Cosby's third album was recorded. It might be necessary to clarify the question or correct any misinformation to proceed further.\n"

In the early 1980s, he emigrated to the United States and wrote for The Nation and Vanity Fair. Known as \"one of the 'four horsemen'\" (along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett) of New Atheism, he gained prominence as a columnist and speaker. His epistemological razor, which states that \"what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\", is still of mark in philosophy and law.[4][5]. Hitchens's political views evolved greatly throughout his life.[6] Originally describing himself as a democratic socialist,[7] he was a member of various socialist organisations in his early life, including the Trotskyist International Socialists.[8] He was critical of aspects of American foreign policy, including its involvement in Vietnam, Chile and East Timor.",

Bret McKenzie served as music supervisor, writing four of the film's five original songs, while Christophe Beck composed the score.[8] In the film, devoted Muppet fan Walter, his human brother Gary and Gary's girlfriend Mary help Kermit the Frog reunite the disbanded Muppets, as they must raise $10\u00a0million to save the Muppet Theater from Tex Richman, a greedy businessman who plans to demolish the theater to drill for oil.. Walt Disney Pictures first announced the film in March 2008, with Segel and Stoller as the screenwriters and Hoberman and Lieberman's Mandeville Films as co-producer.[2] Conceived by Disney to serve as a creative reboot of the franchise after years of relative dormancy following their acquisition of the Muppets in 2004, Segel and Stoller intently addressed the characters' recent real-world lack of public exposure in mainstream culture within the context of the film's plot. Though reports indicated Stoller would direct the film, Bobin was ultimately hired to direct in January 2010, and the film's supporting cast was filled out in October of the same year with the casting of Adams, Cooper and Jones.",

The Sh\u014dgitai took a large part in the battles of the Boshin War, especially at the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi, and, after being assigned the defence of Kan'ei-ji temple, the Battle of Ueno, where they were nearly annihilated.[1][2]. After the Battle of Ueno, some surviving Sh\u014dgitai fled north, eventually joining the rebels of the Ezo Republic. Following the defeat of Ezo, most of the few remaining former Sh\u014dgitai settled in Hokkaido as tondenhei.[3] Among the survivors was Toyohara Chikanobu, who later achieved fame as a master nishiki-e artist..

Ferlinghetti was born on March 24, 1919, in Yonkers, New York.[5]. Shortly before his birth, his father, Carlo, a native of Brescia, died of a heart attack;[2] and his mother, Clemence Albertine (n\u00e9e Mendes-Monsanto), of Portuguese Sephardic Jewish descent, was committed to a mental hospital shortly after. He was raised by an aunt, and later by foster parents.[6] He attended the Mount Hermon School for Boys (later Northfield Mount Hermon) graduating in 1937, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a B.A. in journalism in 1941.",

Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.. Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in an area called \"Caos\" (\"Chaos\" in Italian, but in Sicilian dialect lit. \"Trouser\", from the shape of a nearby ravine), near Porto Empedocle, a poor suburb of Girgenti (Agrigento, a town in southern Sicily). His father, Stefano Pirandello, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the sulphur industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento.",

In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage.. Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published.",

His most significant compositions are operas and sacred music. Beethoven regarded Cherubini as the greatest living composer of his era.

This genus is characterized the by presence of three petals (along with the genera Stussenia and Lithobium) as opposed to five in the other members of the family. Most members of the genus prefer growing in shady habitats. It is a large genus including about 175 species.[2]. This is primarily an Asiatic genus of the tropical and subtropical regions distributed from India and Sri Lanka to the Indo-Pacific.[3] The members of the group are generally herbs or under shrubs, including some stemless members.",
