Her other film credits include starring in films such as Where the Boys Are '84, Creature, Going Under and Munchies. She had many guest roles in television series of the mid-1980s, most notably as Marilyn Kelsy in Airwolf. Since 2005 she has primarily worked in voice acting, most notably voicing Francine Smith in the animated comedy television series American Dad!. Schaal was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Lois Schaal (n\u00e9e Treacy) and actor Richard Schaal.[1] Schaal's father was married to actress Valerie Harper from 1964 to 1978, during which time Harper was her stepmother.[2] From birth until she was five, Schaal lived with her parents in Crete, Illinois, at which time she moved with her mother to Newport Beach, California after her parents divorced.[3] Schaal studied acting with Viola Spolin in Chicago when she was nine years old, later moving to Wisconsin and then California when she was 11.", "American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series was moved to TBS in 2014 and continues to air new episodes to this day.[2][3] American Dad! is the first television series made to premiere on Fox's Animation Domination block.[4] The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.[5][6]. Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[7] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes,[3] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[2] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[3] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[3]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Wendy Schaal]", "search[American Dad!]", "finish[Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman]"], ["search[Wendy Schaal]", "search[American Dad!]", "finish[Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman]"], ["search[Wendy Schaal]", "search[American Dad!]", "finish[Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman]"], ["search[Wendy Schaal]", "search[American Dad!]", "finish[Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search Wendy Schaal and find which show or shows she did the voice of Francine.
