Ferlinghetti was born on March 24, 1919, in Yonkers, New York.[5]. Shortly before his birth, his father, Carlo, a native of Brescia, died of a heart attack;[2] and his mother, Clemence Albertine (n\u00e9e Mendes-Monsanto), of Portuguese Sephardic Jewish descent, was committed to a mental hospital shortly after. He was raised by an aunt, and later by foster parents.[6] He attended the Mount Hermon School for Boys (later Northfield Mount Hermon) graduating in 1937, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a B.A. in journalism in 1941.", "Luigi Pirandello (Italian: [lu\u02c8i\u02d0d\u0292i piran\u02c8d\u025bllo]; 28 June 1867 \u2013 10 December 1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays.[1] He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his bold and ingenious revival of dramatic and scenic art\" [2] Pirandello's works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.. Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in an area called \"Caos\" (\"Chaos\" in Italian, but in Sicilian dialect lit. \"Trouser\", from the shape of a nearby ravine), near Porto Empedocle, a poor suburb of Girgenti (Agrigento, a town in southern Sicily).
