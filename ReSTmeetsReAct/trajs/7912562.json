There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": ["search[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss naval ships]", "search[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss]", "finish[new, small, and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and later submarines]"], "thoughts": ["I need to search for the naval ships that carried the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and determine what objects they were defending against in battle.\n", "Thought 2: Since I cannot find specific information about the naval ships that carried the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss, I will instead search for general information about the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun and its use in naval warfare.\n", "The answer is that the objects carried into battle by these naval ships, for which the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss were introduced to defend against, were new, small, and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and later submarines.
