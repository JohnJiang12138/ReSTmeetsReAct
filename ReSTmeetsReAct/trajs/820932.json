Stein added, \"You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men, and for some of the same reasons.", "Rabindranath Tagore FRAS (/r\u0259\u02c8b\u026andr\u0259n\u0251\u02d0t t\u00e6\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u02d0r/ \u24d8; pronounced [ro\u02c8bind\u027eonat\u02b0 \u02c8\u0288\u02b0aku\u027e];[1] 7 May 1861[2]\u00a0\u2013 7 August 1941[3]) was a Bengali polymath who was active as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer, and painter during the age of Bengal Renaissance.[4][5][6] He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[John O'Hara]", "search[Rabindranath Tagore]", "finish[no]"], ["search[John O'Hara]", "search[Rabindranath Tagore]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[John O'Hara]", "search[Rabindranath Tagore]", "finish[no]"], ["search[John O'Hara]", "search[Rabindranath Tagore]", "finish[no]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search John O'Hara and Rabindranath Tagore, find their nationalities, then find if they are the same.", "John O'Hara is an American writer.

The first civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. The second war lasted until October 23, 2020, when all parties agreed to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations.[6]. The crisis in Libya has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups.[7][8].", "Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi[pron 1] (c.\u20091942\u00a0\u2013 20 October 2011) was a Libyan revolutionary, politician and political theorist who ruled Libya from 1969 until his assassination by rebel forces in 2011. He first served as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the Brotherly Leader of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, Gaddafi later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.. Born near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin Arab family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libya]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi]", "finish[]"], ["search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War Libya title]", "search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "finish[Libyan Leader or Former Libyan Leader]", "finish[]"], ["search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi]", "search[Libyan Civil War]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "finish[]"], ["search[Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "search[Libyan Civil War]", "search[Muammar Gaddafi Libyan Civil War]", "finish[]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi, find his title during the Libyan Civil War.", "I should search \"Muammar Gaddafi\" instead.", "I should try searching with just 'Muammar Gaddafi' and 'Libyan Civil War' to see if there are any relevant results.", "I should try searching with just 'Muammar Gaddafi' and 'Libya' to see if there are any relevant results.", "The search for 'Libyan Civil War' did not provide any relevant results.

Taylor, c.\u20091908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"Boston Red Stockings\", including the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves).[4] The team has won nine World Series championships, tied for the third-most of any MLB team, and has played in 13 World Series.", "Fenway Park is a baseball stadium located in Boston, Massachusetts, less than one mile from Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the ballpark of Major League Baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox. While the stadium was built in 1912, it was substantially rebuilt in 1934,[9] and underwent major renovations and modifications in the 21st century.. It is the oldest active ballpark in MLB.[10] Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense Fenway\u2013Kenmore neighborhood, the park has many quirky features, including \"The Triangle\", Pesky's Pole, and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fifth-smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second-smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators..", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]", "search[Boston Red Sox stadium]", "search[Fenway Park largest shipping facility]", "finish[Boston Harbor]"], ["search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]", "search[Boston Red Sox]", "search[Fenway Park]", "finish[Boston Harbor]"], ["search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]", "search[Boston Red Sox]", "search[Fenway Park largest shipping facility]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]", "search[Boston Red Sox]", "finish[Fenway Park]", "finish[The Port of Boston]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search for the largest shipping facility in the Northeastern United States, find the name, then find if the Boston Red Sox play there.", "The Boston Red Sox are a baseball team.

Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release.[6] The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.[7].

Some species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, especially as houseplants, and have become naturalized on a few tropical islands.[1][4][5]. Dieffenbachia is a perennial herbaceous plant with straight stem, simple and alternate leaves containing white spots and flecks, making it attractive as indoor foliage. Species in this genus are popular as houseplants because of their tolerance of shade. The English names, dumb cane and mother-in-law's tongue (also used for Sansevieria species) refer to the poisoning effect of raphides, which can cause temporary inability to speak.[6] Dieffenbachia was named by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, director of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, to honor his head gardener Joseph Dieffenbach (1790\u20131863)..", "Carlina is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.[2][3] It is distributed from Madeira and the Canary Islands across Europe and northern Africa to Siberia and northwestern China.[4][5][6].

Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were interred in the ash; their eventual decay allowed archaeologists to create moulds of figures in their final moments of life.

In 1996, Senreich was employed by Wizard Entertainment, gradually rising to become its editorial director.[3] In 1996 or 1997, Senreich met Green when the actor, a fan of Wizard magazine, responded enthusiastically to an interview request.[4] With Green, Senreich created in 2000 and 2001 Sweet J Presents, a web-based series of animated shorts presented on screenblast.com. Adult Swim contracted the Robot Chicken series on the basis of these shorts.[3]. Senreich and Green together run the production company Stoopid Monkey.[3] His Emmy nominations were shared with other key members of the  production staff of Robot Chicken, including partner Seth Green, for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[5] Senreich received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program (shared with key members of his production staff) at the 62nd annual Emmy Award ceremony held on August 29, 2010.[6].", "Zeb Wells is an American comic book writer, screenwriter, director, and voice actor.

Robot Chicken has won two Annie Awards and six Emmy Awards.[3][4]. Robot Chicken was conceptually preceded by \"Twisted ToyFare Theatre\", a humorous photo comic strip appearing in ToyFare: The Toy Magazine.[5] Matthew Senreich, an editor for ToyFare, got in touch with actor Seth Green when the former learned that the latter had made action figures of castmates from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and asked to photograph them.[6] Months later, Green asked Senreich to collaborate on an animated short for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, featuring toy versions of himself and O'Brien.[6] This led to the 12-episode stop-motion series Sweet J Presents on the Sony website Screenblast.com in 2001.[6] Conan O'Brien is voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane in the first episode (\"Conan's Big Fun\").[6][7].", "Invalid action: refine search query", "Could not find Robot Chicken cast.

As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee\u2013broombush in the absence on Triodia (Spinefex); in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s category for the Reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[town located 10 km north of Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "search[Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "finish[Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road]"], ["search[town located 10 km north of Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "search[Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "finish[Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road]"], ["search[town located 10 km north of the Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "search[Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "finish[West Wyalong]"], ["search[town located 10 km north of the Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "search[Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve]", "finish[Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search for the town located 10 km north of the Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve and find the crossroads it is located at.", "The search result did not give the desired information.

Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture\u00a0and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. In 1965, the group released its debut studio album, The Wailing Wailers, which included the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search James Hetfield and Bob Marley, find their professions, then find what they have in common.", "James Hetfield is a musician.

Initial attempts to emulate American rock and roll took place in Britain in the mid-1950s, but the terms \"rock music\" and \"rock\" usually refer to the music derived from the blues rock and other genres that emerged during the 1960s. The term is often used in combination with other terms to describe a variety of hybrids or subgenres, and is often contrasted with pop music, with which it shares many structures and instrumentation.

Rock also drew strongly from genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 44 time signature using a verse\u2013chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse.
