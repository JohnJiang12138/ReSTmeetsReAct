While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century.[2][3][4] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O\u2019Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of The Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work.

Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.

In 1896, Carlton joined the breakaway Victorian Football League (since renamed the AFL), and alongside rivals Collingwood, Essendon, and Richmond, is regarded as one of the league's historical \"Big Four\" clubs, having won sixteen VFL/AFL premierships, equal with Collingwood and Essendon as the most of any AFL club.. Carlton's headquarters and training facilities are located in Carlton North at Princes Park, its traditional home ground, and it currently plays its home matches at Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Initially modeling his style on Woody Guthrie's folk songs,[7] Robert Johnson's blues,[8] and what he called the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams's country songs,[9] Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\".[4] His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.[10].

It can be considered an opera. The composer himself penned the French libretto with contributions from Saint-Pol-Roux, a symbolist poet and the inspiration of the surrealists.[1] It is an atmospheric story of working-class life in Paris, with the city itself invoked along the way:[2] young Louise, a seamstress living with her parents, loves Julien, an artist; she desires freedom, associated in her mind with him and the city. (Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera Julien, describing the artist's aspirations.) Musically the work is considered an example of verismo, and marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera..

Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Jonci\u00e8res, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set.

Born to a Jewish family,[2] Senreich graduated from Herricks High School in New Hyde Park, New York.[citation needed]. In 1996, Senreich was employed by Wizard Entertainment, gradually rising to become its editorial director.[3] In 1996 or 1997, Senreich met Green when the actor, a fan of Wizard magazine, responded enthusiastically to an interview request.[4] With Green, Senreich created in 2000 and 2001 Sweet J Presents, a web-based series of animated shorts presented on screenblast.com. Adult Swim contracted the Robot Chicken series on the basis of these shorts.[3]. Senreich and Green together run the production company Stoopid Monkey.[3] His Emmy nominations were shared with other key members of the  production staff of Robot Chicken, including partner Seth Green, for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[5] Senreich received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program (shared with key members of his production staff) at the 62nd annual Emmy Award ceremony held on August 29, 2010.[6].", "Robot Chicken is an American adult stop motion-animated sketch comedy television series created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The writers, most prominently Green, also provide many of the voices. Senreich, Douglas Goldstein, and Tom Root were formerly writers for the popular action figure hobbyist magazine ToyFare. Robot Chicken has won two Annie Awards and six Emmy Awards.[3][4]. Robot Chicken was conceptually preceded by \"Twisted ToyFare Theatre\", a humorous photo comic strip appearing in ToyFare: The Toy Magazine.[5] Matthew Senreich, an editor for ToyFare, got in touch with actor Seth Green when the former learned that the latter had made action figures of castmates from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and asked to photograph them.[6] Months later, Green asked Senreich to collaborate on an animated short for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, featuring toy versions of himself and O'Brien.[6] This led to the 12-episode stop-motion series Sweet J Presents on the Sony website Screenblast.com in 2001.[6] Conan O'Brien is voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane in the first episode (\"Conan's Big Fun\").[6][7].", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "search[\"Robot Chicken\" \"July 1983\"]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "search[\"Robot Chicken\" \"July 1983\"]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "search[\"Robot Chicken\" \"July 1983\"]"], ["search[Matthew Senreich]", "search[Robot Chicken]", "finish[Seth Green]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search Matthew Senreich and Zeb Wells, find the star of their comedy, and then find their birth date.

It tells the story of a prolonged feud between two stage magicians in late 1800s England. Its structure is that of a collection of diaries that were kept by the protagonists and later collated. The title derives from the novel's fictional practice of stage illusions having three parts: the setup, the performance, and the prestige (effect).[1].

The series has been a ratings success in its time slot, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program four times (2014\u20132017) in the first four years of that category's existence.[3]. The show features a panel of investors called \"sharks,\" who decide whether to invest as entrepreneurs make business presentations on their company or product.[4][5] The sharks often find weaknesses and faults in an entrepreneur's product, business model or valuation of their company.[6] Some of the investors are usually kindhearted and try to soften the impact of rejection, like panel member Barbara Corcoran, while others such as Kevin O'Leary can be \"brutal\" and show \"no patience even for tales of hardship\".[6] The sharks are paid as cast stars of the show, but a disclaimer at the start of each episode states the money they invest is their own.[7] The same disclaimer also states that no offer of investment is being made to the viewer. The entrepreneur can make a handshake deal (gentleman's agreement) on the show if a panel member is interested. However, if all of the panel members opt out, the entrepreneur leaves empty-handed.[6].", "Could not find Roominate Shark Tank.

As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee\u2013broombush in the absence on Triodia (Spinefex); in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s category for the Reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5].

Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture\u00a0and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. In 1965, the group released its debut studio album, The Wailing Wailers, which included the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"], ["search[James Hetfield]", "search[Bob Marley]", "finish[yes]"]], "thoughts": [["I need to search James Hetfield and Bob Marley, find what they are, then find what they have in common.", "James Hetfield is a musician.
