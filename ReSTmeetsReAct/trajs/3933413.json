The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].", "The Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: Esma Sultan Yal\u0131s\u0131), a historical yal\u0131 located on the Bosphorus in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Princess Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped..
