Mawsim al-Hijrah il\u00e2 al-Sham\u00e2l is considered to be an important turning point in the development of postcolonial narratives that focus on the encounter between East and West.[1].", "Isaac Bashevis Singer (Yiddish: \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 \u05d1\u05d0\u05b7\u05e9\u05e2\u05f0\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05e8; 1904[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] \u2013 July 24, 1991) was a Polish-born Jewish-American novelist, short-story writer, memoirist, essayist, and translator. Some of his works were adapted for the theater. He wrote and published first in Yiddish and later translated his own works into English with the help of editors and collaborators.[9][10][11][12] He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978.[13][14] A leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, he was awarded two U.S. National Book Awards, one in Children's Literature for his memoir A Day of Pleasure: Stories of a Boy Growing Up in Warsaw (1970)[15] and one in Fiction for his collection A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories (1974).[16]. Isaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1903[2] to a Jewish family in Leoncin village near Warsaw, Poland.[17] The Polish form of his birth name was Icek Hersz Zynger.[18] The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most sources say it was probably November 11, a date similar to the one that Singer gave to his official biographer Paul Kresh,[19] his secretary Dvorah Telushkin,[20] and Rabbi William Berkowitz.[21] The year 1903 is consistent with the historical events that his brother refers to in their childhood memoirs, including the death of Theodor Herzl.", "Episode finished, reward = 0\n"], "actions": [["search[Season of Migration to the North]", "finish[I.B.

Louise was premiered on 2 February 1900 at the Salle Favart by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique conducted by Andr\u00e9 Messager in a production by Albert Carr\u00e9.", "Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui  (King in Spite of Himself or The reluctant king) is an op\u00e9ra-comique in three acts by Emmanuel Chabrier of 1887 with an original libretto by Emile de Najac and Paul Burani.[1] The opera is revived occasionally, but has not yet found a place in repertory.. Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Jonci\u00e8res, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set. Jonci\u00e8res had been sent Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui, an old vaudeville of 1836[5] written by Marguerite-Louise Virginie Ancelot (1792\u20131875), by Ancelot's daughter Mme Lachaud.[6] However, Jonci\u00e8res passed the play to Chabrier, and also introduced Chabrier to L\u00e9on Carvalho, to whom Chabrier played some 'audition' pieces, which convinced the Op\u00e9ra-Comique director to stage his work.[7].

Their lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik M\u00f6bus is the founder of the Deutsche Heidnische Front), pro-heathen revivalist Germanic, and anti-Judeo-Christian themes.. The band achieved infamy because its original members (not in the band since 1999) murdered Sandro Beyer, a 15-year-old boy,[6] in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band.[7] On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members M\u00f6bus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord.", "Could not find Absurd band.

Although beer was a part of colonial life in the United States, the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1919 resulted in the prohibition of alcoholic beverage sales, forcing nearly all American breweries to close or switch to producing non-alcoholic products. After the repeal of Prohibition, the industry consolidated into a small number of large-scale breweries.

The Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras is a Hindu text,[note 1] notable for focusing on knowledge and logic, and making no mention of Vedic rituals.[9] The first book is structured as a general introduction and table of contents of sixteen categories of knowledge.[3] Book two is about pramana (epistemology), book three is about prameya or the objects of knowledge, and the text discusses the nature of knowledge in remaining books.[3] It set the foundation for Nyaya tradition of the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.[10]. The Nyaya sutras cover a wide range of topics, including Tarka-Vidy\u0101, the science of debate or V\u0101da-Vidy\u0101, the science of discussion.[11] The Ny\u0101ya Sutras are related to but extend the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika epistemological and metaphysical system.[12] Later commentaries expanded, expounded and discussed Nyaya sutras, the earlier surviving commentaries being by Pak\u1e63ilasv\u0101min V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (5th\u20136th Century CE), followed by the Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttika of Uddyotak\u0101ra (6th\u20137th Century CE), V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra's T\u0101tparyat\u012bk\u0101 (9th Century CE), Udayana's T\u0101tparyapari\u015buddhi (10th Century CE), and Jayanta's Ny\u0101yama\u00f1jar\u012b (10th Century CE).[13][14][15].

There are cultural and religious traditions that place special value and significance on this state, predominantly towards unmarried females, associated with notions of personal purity, honor, and worth. Like chastity, the concept of virginity has traditionally involved sexual abstinence. The concept of virginity usually involves moral or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social status and in interpersonal relationships.[3][10] Although virginity has social implications and had significant legal implications in some societies in the past, it has no legal consequences in most societies today. The social implications of virginity still remain in many societies and can have varying effects on an individual's social agency..", "Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, and 1982's The Number of the Beast \u2013 its first album with Bruce Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was a turning point in their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important bands.[2] The Number of the Beast is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.[3]. After some turbulence in the 1990s, the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 saw the band undergo a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours.[4] Their three most recent albums \u2014 The Final Frontier (2010), The Book of Souls (2015), and Senjutsu (2021) \u2014 have all reached No.\u00a01 in more than 25 countries.[5][6][7] Iron Maiden have sold over 130\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide and have obtained over\u00a0600 certifications.", "Could not find World Wide Blitz Tour support.

Since then, it has been revised a few times, most recently on December 7, 2019.[2] As it stands, money earned and accumulated under a contract under the code remains the sole legal property of the minor child.[3][4] The law requires a child actor's employer to set aside 15% of the earnings in a trust (often called a Coogan Account) and codifies issues such as schooling, work hours, and time off.[5]. The current version of the law is codified in sections 6750\u201353 of the California Family Code and section 1700.37 of the California Labor Code.

The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].", "Invalid action: finish[Laleli Mosque]\nObservation", "Invalid action: finish[Esma Sultan Mansion]\nQuestion: Do the Birth of a Nation and The General have the same director?", "The Birth of a Nation, originally called The Clansman,[5] is a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed by D.

Patrick and musician Brian Liesegang initially conceived the idea of forming their own band after hiking at the Grand Canyon; Filter was subsequently formed in 1993.[4] The line-up also briefly featured guitarist Stuart Zechman, who departed Filter to join Stabbing Westward.[5] Stabbing Westward reportedly used the chorus guitar riff of \"Hey Man, Nice Shot\" on the title track of their 1994 album, Ungod; Patrick alleges that Zechman was in his presence while writing the riff and subsequently copied it.[6].

After Liesegang's departure in 1997, Patrick recorded a follow-up album with the Short Bus touring band members, who became full-time members thereafter.

Farmer often mixed real and classic fictional characters and worlds and real and fake authors as epitomized by his Wold Newton family books, which tie classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy.
