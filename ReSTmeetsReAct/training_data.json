The series was moved to TBS in 2014 and continues to air new episodes to this day.[2][3] American Dad! is the first television series made to premiere on Fox's Animation Domination block.[4] The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.[5][6]. Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[7] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes,[3] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[2] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[3] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[3]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ",

Instead of focusing on the specific waterfowl present, I can consider the general characteristics of medium-sized waterfowl.

        "output": "Thought 5: Since my previous attempts to find a definitive answer have been unsuccessful, I will try to provide a more general answer based on the information available. Given that Hardley Flood is an area of lagoons that support populations of waterfowl, and that waterfowl come in various sizes, it is reasonable to assume that the medium-sized version of the animal being referred to could be a duck, goose, or swan. These are common medium-sized waterfowl that are often found in such habitats. However, without specific information about the waterfowl present at Hardley Flood, it is impossible to determine which one is the correct answer.\n Action 5: finish[The medium-sized waterfowl at Hardley Flood could potentially be a duck, goose, or swan, but without specific information, it is impossible to determine which one is the correct answer.]"

Though shorter and somewhat rounder than its immediate neighbors when viewed from the more common eastern approaches, it is difficult to access due to snow danger and being flanked by active glaciers in all directions.

These schools of thought emphasize the importance of understanding and addressing the lasting impacts of colonialism on colonized peoples and their cultures.\n\nTherefore, while Hafiz Rashid Khan's work may be primarily influenced by Neo-colonialism, it also likely draws from broader schools of thought that are concerned with analyzing and responding to colonial legacies.\n Action 3: finish[Postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the information available in the observation and the understanding of postcolonialism and related schools of thought. However, it is important to recognize that Hafiz Rashid Khan's specific academic discipline and influences may be more complex and nuanced than what can be inferred from this limited information. Observation 3: Invalid action: finish[Postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the information available in the observation and the understanding of postcolonialism and related schools of thought.

        "output": "Thought 4: Apologies for the confusion in the previous answer. It seems there was an error in providing the final answer. While Hafiz Rashid Khan's work is influenced by postcolonialism, the specific schools of thought drawn from in his academic discipline may not be limited to postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory. These are certainly relevant and influential schools of thought in the broader postcolonial conversation, but Hafiz Rashid Khan's work may also draw from other specific theoretical frameworks or academic traditions.\n\nTo accurately answer the question, we would need more detailed information about Hafiz Rashid Khan's academic background, research interests, and the specific context of his work. However, based on the available information, we can tentatively suggest that his academic discipline may draw from a range of schools of thought related to postcolonialism, including but not limited to postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory.\n Action 4: finish[Hafiz Rashid Khan's academic discipline may draw from a range of schools of thought related to postcolonialism, including but not limited to postcolonial theory, critical race theory, and decolonial theory.

Thought 2: I need to narrow down my search to find an actor born in 1955 who specifically acted in the movie Ransom. I can try searching for \"Ransom movie cast\" to find the actors in the movie and then cross-reference their birth years.\n Action 2: search[Ransom movie cast] Observation 2: Could not find Ransom movie cast. Similar: ['Ransomed', \"Brooke D'Orsay\", 'Ransom (1996 film)', 'Nicole Ari Parker', 'Man on Fire (2004 film) (section Cast)']. Thought 3: It seems like the search for \"Ransom movie cast\" did not yield the desired result. I need to refine my search query. Instead of searching for the cast of the movie Ransom directly, I can try searching for the movie title \"Ransom\" and then look for information about its cast members.\n Action 3: search[Ransom (1996 film)] Observation 3: Ransom is a 1996 American action thriller film[5] directed by Ron Howard from a screenplay by Richard Price and Alexander Ignon. The film stars Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Brawley Nolte, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg and Evan Handler. Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States. The original story came from a 1954 episode of The United States Steel Hour titled \"Fearful Decision\". Thought 4: According to the search result, Mel Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his performance in the movie Ransom. However, I still need to verify if Mel Gibson was born in 1955 to answer the original question accurately.\n Action 4: search[Mel Gibson birth year] Observation 4: Could not find Mel Gibson birth year. Similar: ['Mel Gibson', 'Milo Gibson', 'Donal Gibson', 'Oksana Grigorieva (category 1970 births)', 'Josie Gibson']. Thought 5: It seems like the search for Mel Gibson's birth year did not return the exact result. However, I know from my general knowledge that Mel Gibson was not born in 1955. Therefore, the actor nominated for an award for their performance in the movie Ransom and born in 1955 is not Mel Gibson. I need to go back to the list of actors in the Ransom movie and check their birth years.\n Action 5: search[Ransom 1996 film cast birth years] Observation 5: Could not find Ransom 1996 film cast birth years. Similar: ['Fargo (1996 film)', 'Scott Speedman (category Canadian male film actors)', 'Nicole Ari Parker (category American film actresses)', 'Liev Schreiber (category Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Screen Actors Guild Award winners)', 'List of 1990s films based on actual events']. Thought 6: Since the direct search for the cast's birth years is not yielding results, I will need to manually search for each actor's birth year. This process may be time-consuming, but it is necessary to answer the question accurately. I will start with the actors listed in the Ransom movie and check their birth years until I find one born in 1955.\n Action 6: manual search for actors' birth years Observation 6: Invalid action: manual search for actors' birth years Thought 7: I apologize for the confusion. It seems like my previous thought process was not accurate. Since the manual search for actors' birth years is not a valid action, I will need to adjust my approach. Instead of manually searching for each actor's birth year, I can try searching for the actors' names individually and check their birth years on their respective Wikipedia pages. This way, I can quickly identify if any of them were born in 1955 and nominated for an award for their performance in Ransom.\n Action 7: search[Ransom 1996 film actors] Observation 7: Could not find Ransom 1996 film actors.

The story is based loosely on the life of the French poet André Chénier (1762–1794), who was executed during the French Revolution. The character Carlo Gérard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice.

The play is Andrea Chénier, an opera in four acts by Umberto Giordano. Now, to answer the original question, we need to find the name of the third act. However, the observation did not provide the name of the third act specifically. Typically, the names of acts in operas are not as widely known as the overall title, and often they are simply referred to by their number (Act I, Act II, etc.). Without additional information or a specific source that provides the names of the acts in Andrea Chénier, we cannot determine the name of the third act.\n Action 7: finish[The name of the third act is not provided in the available information.]"

The name Tibouchina is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus.[3] A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic,[4] and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus.[9]. Tibouchina species are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees. Their leaves are opposite, usually with petioles, and often covered with scales.

I need to reevaluate the question and search for the correct information. The question is asking about Bob Dylan's song \"High Water,\" which was based on the 1927 Louisiana Flood, and another song he recorded about the same event, \"When the Levee Breaks.\" I need to find out who wrote and recorded the original version of \"When the Levee Breaks\" that Bob Dylan might have been influenced by, rather than focusing on the year 1929.\n Action 5: search[Original artist of \"When the Levee Breaks\"] Observation 5: Could not find Original artist of \"When the Levee Breaks\".

",
        "output": "Thought 6: The search results are still not providing a direct answer to the original artist of \"When the Levee Breaks.\" However, based on the search results and my knowledge of music history, I believe that the song \"When the Levee Breaks\" is most commonly associated with Memphis Minnie, even though she might not have been the original artist. Memphis Minnie was a blues singer and guitarist who recorded many songs throughout her career. It's possible that Bob Dylan was influenced by her version of the song when he recorded his own version about the 1927 Louisiana Flood.\n Action 6: finish[Memphis Minnie is commonly associated with the song \"When the Levee Breaks,\" even though she might not have been the original artist.

It was directed by Kirk Jones, coproduced by StudioCanal, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Working Title Films, Three Strange Angels, and Nanny McPhee Productions with music by Patrick Doyle, and produced by Lindsay Doran, Tim Bevan, and Eric Fellner. Set in Victorian England in the 1860s, the film stars Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee, along with Colin Firth and Angela Lansbury.. The film was theatrically released on 28 October 2005 in the UK by United International Pictures and on 27 January 2006 in the US by Universal Pictures. Thompson also scripted the film, which is adapted from Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books. ",
        "output": "Thought 5: Based on the search results for \"Nanny McPhee,\" it appears that the film is set in Victorian England in the 1860s. Therefore, the setting for Raphaël Coleman's best-known film was Victorian England.\n Action 5: finish[Victorian England]"

Similar: ['Boston Red Sox', 'Boston–Halifax relations', 'Boston', 'Timeline of Boston', 'Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. fire'].

Similar: ['Worcester Red Sox', 'Boston Red Sox', '2004 Boston Red Sox season', 'Logos and uniforms of the Boston Red Sox', 'Pawtucket Red Sox']. Thought 4: My previous searches haven't been fruitful, so I'll try a more direct approach. I'll search for the name of the Boston Red Sox's stadium, which is Fenway Park, and then see if there's any information about a large shipping facility nearby.\n Action 4: search[Fenway Park] Observation 4: Fenway Park is a baseball stadium located in Boston, Massachusetts, less than one mile from Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the ballpark of Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox. While the stadium was built in 1912, it was substantially rebuilt in 1934,[9] and underwent major renovations and modifications in the 21st century.. It is the oldest active ballpark in MLB.[10] Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood, the park has many quirky features, including \"The Triangle\", Pesky's Pole, and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fifth-smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second-smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators.. Thought 5: Now that I have information about Fenway Park, I can search for shipping facilities near it. However, based on my knowledge of Boston and Fenway Park, I don't believe there is a large shipping facility directly adjacent to the stadium. Additionally, the question may contain a typo or error, as the Boston Red Sox are a baseball team and not typically associated with shipping facilities. I'll double-check the question for any potential errors.\n Action 5: double-check question for errors Observation 5: Invalid action: double-check question for errors Thought 6: I apologize for the confusion, but it seems like there may be a typo in the question. The Boston Red Sox are a baseball team, and as such, they play at a baseball stadium called Fenway Park, not a shipping facility. Perhaps the question meant to ask about the largest shipping facility in the Northeastern United States, but there's no direct connection to the Boston Red Sox or their stadium. If the question is indeed about the largest shipping facility in the region, I can try to provide information on that.\n Action 6: search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]\nObservation Observation 6: Invalid action: search[largest shipping facility Northeastern United States]\nObservation Thought 7: I apologize for the confusion and the incorrect actions taken.

The composer himself penned the French libretto with contributions from Saint-Pol-Roux, a symbolist poet and the inspiration of the surrealists.[1] It is an atmospheric story of working-class life in Paris, with the city itself invoked along the way:[2] young Louise, a seamstress living with her parents, loves Julien, an artist; she desires freedom, associated in her mind with him and the city. (Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera Julien, describing the artist's aspirations.) Musically the work is considered an example of verismo, and marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera.. Louise was premiered on 2 February 1900 at the Salle Favart by the Opéra-Comique conducted by André Messager in a production by Albert Carré. ",

Action 5: search[Le roi malgré lui] Observation 5: Le roi malgré lui  (King in Spite of Himself or The reluctant king) is an opéra-comique in three acts by Emmanuel Chabrier of 1887 with an original libretto by Emile de Najac and Paul Burani.[1] The opera is revived occasionally, but has not yet found a place in repertory.. Eric Blom wrote that the tragic fate of the opera was to be written a quarter of a century too soon.[2] However, the music has been greatly admired by composers including d'Indy, Ravel and Stravinsky.[3]. Around May 1883 Chabrier wrote to his publishers that for his next stage work he was hoping to create something like Offenbach's successful 'grand fantaisie' Le roi Carotte.[4] According to Victorin de Joncières, Chabrier had confided to him that he was looking for an amusing book to set. Joncières had been sent Le roi malgré lui, an old vaudeville of 1836[5] written by Marguerite-Louise Virginie Ancelot (1792–1875), by Ancelot's daughter Mme Lachaud.[6] However, Joncières passed the play to Chabrier, and also introduced Chabrier to Léon Carvalho, to whom Chabrier played some 'audition' pieces, which convinced the Opéra-Comique director to stage his work.[7]. An article by Theodore Massiac[8] described in some detail Chabrier's composition process for Le roi malgré lui. ",

Action 1: search[Fort Snelling] Observation 1: Fort Snelling is a former military fortification and National Historic Landmark in the U.S. state of Minnesota on the bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The military site was initially named Fort Saint Anthony, but it was renamed Fort Snelling once its construction was completed in 1825.. Before the American Civil War, the U.S. Army supported slavery at the fort by allowing its soldiers to bring their personal enslaved people. Thought 2: Now I know Fort Snelling is in Minnesota, but I need to be more specific about the county. I should search for the location of Fort Snelling in Minnesota. Saint Paul is also mentioned, so I should search for its location as well to see if it's in the same county as Fort Snelling.\n Action 2: search[Fort Snelling location Minnesota] Observation 2: Could not find Fort Snelling location Minnesota. Similar: ['Fort Snelling (unorganized territory), Minnesota', 'Fort Snelling', 'Fort Snelling National Cemetery', 'Fort Snelling State Park', 'Fort Snelling station']. Thought 3: The search result didn't give me the specific county for Fort Snelling, but it did provide some related information about the fort. I should try a different approach and search for the county where Fort Snelling is located directly. Additionally, I'll search for Saint Paul's location to see if it mentions the county as well.\n Action 3: search[Fort Snelling located in which county Minnesota] Observation 3: Could not find Fort Snelling located in which county Minnesota. Similar: ['Fort Snelling (unorganized territory), Minnesota', 'Fort Snelling', 'Fort Snelling station', 'Dakota County, Minnesota', 'History of Minnesota']. Thought 4: The search results still haven't provided the specific county for Fort Snelling. However, one of the similar search suggestions is \"Dakota County, Minnesota.\" It's possible that Fort Snelling is located in Dakota County. I should verify this by searching for Fort Snelling in Dakota County specifically. Additionally, I'll continue my search for Saint Paul's location to confirm if it's in the same county.\n Action 4: search[Fort Snelling Dakota County Minnesota] Observation 4: Could not find Fort Snelling Dakota County Minnesota. Similar: ['Fort Snelling', 'Dakota War of 1862', 'Fort Snelling (unorganized territory), Minnesota', 'Dakota County, Minnesota', 'Fort Snelling State Park']. Thought 5: Despite several attempts, I haven't been able to confirm the exact county where Fort Snelling is located through direct searches. However, since Saint Paul is mentioned in the question, and it's a well-known city in Minnesota, I should be able to find its county easily. Then, I can assume that Fort Snelling, which spurred the growth of Saint Paul, is likely located in the same county.\n Action 5: search[Saint Paul located in which county Minnesota] Observation 5: Could not find Saint Paul located in which county Minnesota. Similar: ['Ramsey County, Minnesota', 'Dakota County, Minnesota', 'Hennepin County, Minnesota', 'Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport', 'History of Saint Paul, Minnesota']. Thought 6: The search results for Saint Paul's location in Minnesota suggest Ramsey County as a possible county. Although it didn't provide a direct answer, it's likely that Saint Paul is located in Ramsey County, given its prominence in the state. Assuming Fort Snelling spurred the growth of Saint Paul, it's reasonable to infer that Fort Snelling is also located in Ramsey County.\n Action 6: finish[Ramsey County]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on inference and may not be entirely accurate. It's always best to consult official sources for precise location information. Observation 6: Invalid action: finish[Ramsey County]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on inference and may not be entirely accurate. It's always best to consult official sources for precise location information. Thought 7: Apologies for the confusion in the previous steps. Let me clarify the approach. Since Fort Snelling spurred the growth of Saint Paul, it stands to reason that they are likely located in the same county. Saint Paul is the capital city of Minnesota and is located in Ramsey County. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Fort Snelling, which had a significant impact on Saint Paul's growth, is also located in Ramsey County.\n Action 7: finish[Ramsey County]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the inference that Fort Snelling and Saint Paul are located in the same county, given their historical connection. While this inference is reasonable, it's always best to consult official sources for precise location information. Observation 7: Invalid action: finish[Ramsey County]\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the inference that Fort Snelling and Saint Paul are located in the same county, given their historical connection.

A non-canon prequel to the original 2002 film that detailed Stitch's \"first\" prison escape, it was located in the Tomorrowland area of Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort, as the fourth attraction to occupy the building and theater space that was previously used for Flight to the Moon, Mission to Mars and the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, many of the animators who worked on Lilo & Stitch were directly involved with the attraction's development. The attraction, which struggled with a mixed reception from park guests during its existence,[3] was the only major permanent attraction based on Lilo & Stitch to have operated in the United States; all other such major attractions since have been exclusive to non-American Disney Parks resorts.. On September 21, 2003, Magic Kingdom announced that a new Lilo & Stitch themed attraction would be replacing ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter.[4] On October 10, the park announced more details about the new attraction.

The 86.4-hectare (213-acre) reserve is situated 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of West Wyalong and may be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.[2] The reserve is an important refuge for native flora and fauna in a highly fragmented landscape, one in which the majority of the original vegetation has been removed.[2][3]. The land surrounding the reserve has been extensively altered through agricultural practice and the development of roads. As a remnant in a highly modified landscape, the reserve's vegetation is significant to the region as it includes critically endangered mallee and mallee–broombush in the absence on Triodia (Spinefex); in total there are only three protected areas within New South Wales containing this now rare vegetative structure.[2][4] The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s category for the Reserve is Ia, a protected area that is dedicated to conserving biodiversity and minimising disturbances by limiting human access.[5]. The reserve is relatively flat with a dry, red, loamy clay top soil; three man-made dams are situated along a drainage line that runs the length of the reserve.[2][6]. Thought 3: The search result provided information about the Charcoal Tank Nature Reserve but did not mention any specific town located 10 km north of it. However, it mentioned that the reserve can be accessed via the Newell Highway and The Charcoal Tank Road.

Action 1: search[Kam Heskin] Observation 1: Kam Erika Heskin (born May 8, 1973)[1] is an American actress. She began her career playing Caitlin Deschanel on the NBC daytime soap opera Sunset Beach (1998–1999), before appearing in films Planet of the Apes (2001) and Catch Me If You Can (2002). Heskin went on in 2003 to play Elizabeth Bennet in an independent film Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy, Robin in Charmed (2004),  and Paige Morgan in The Prince and Me film franchise (2006–2010).. Heskin was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota.[2] She attended Grand Junction High School[citation needed] before she went on to study at Concordia College in Minnesota, graduating with a degree in Communications and Political Science.[2] The day after graduation, she moved to Chicago and modeled for the next couple of months before moving to New York City..

He was the son of actor Danny Aiello.[4]. Aiello died of pancreatic cancer, age 53, in Hillsdale, New Jersey, on May 1, 2010. He was survived by his wife, two daughters, parents, and three siblings.[1] The first episode of the second season of Royal Pains, \"Spasticity\", was dedicated to him, as was the first episode of the sixth season of Rescue Me, \"Legacy\".. This article about a United States film and television actor born in the 1950s is a stub. Thought 5: Danny Aiello III was an American stunt performer, but there's no mention of \"Stunt Cycle\" in his biography. However, since he was a stunt performer, it's possible that he could have attempted a stunt involving a cycle at some point in his career.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the M1, in this context referring to the M1 Garand, was used by the US military.\n\nFor the M1919 Browning machine gun, although specific search results were not obtained, it is generally known that this weapon was also used by the US military, particularly in World War I and subsequent conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, both the M1919 and the M1 (referring to the M1 Garand) were used by the United States Military.\n Action 4: finish[United States Military]"

Action 2: search[Bob Marley] Observation 2: Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican reggae singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of the genre, Marley fused elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady in his music and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's contribution to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular culture.[4][5] Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] He also supported legalisation of cannabis, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9] In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was believed to be politically motivated.[10]. Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which, after several name changes, would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single \"One Love\", a reworking of \"People Get Ready\"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[11] The Wailers released an additional 11 studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari.

It was originally launched in Norway as Urge in 1996, and was so popular that it was released in the United States as Surge in 1997. Lagging sales caused production to be ended in 2003 for most markets.[1]. However, popular fan bases such as Facebook's \"SURGE Movement\" led Coca-Cola to re-release the soft drink on September 15, 2014, for the US market via Amazon Prime in 12-packs of 16-US-fluid-ounce (470 mL) cans.[2] Following a test-market for the beverage in the Southeastern United States in early 2015, Surge was re-released primarily in convenience stores in the Eastern United States and some Mountain states in September 2015.[citation needed] Surge was re-released internationally in September 2018 in Burger King restaurants in the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines..

Berri’s Jean de Florette is the first adaptation of the first part, while the second had previously been filmed by Pagnol himself in 1952. The story takes place in rural Provence in the 1920s, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property.

They are typically smaller than Western playing cards, only 5.4 by 3.2 cm, but thicker and stiffer,[3] and often with a pronounced curve. On the face of each card is a depiction of plants, tanzaku (短冊), animals, birds, or man-made objects.[4][5] One single card depicts a human. The back side is usually plain, without a pattern or design of any kind, and traditionally coloured either red or black. Hanafuda are used to play a variety of games including Koi-Koi and Hachi-Hachi.. Thought 2: Hanafuda is a type of Japanese playing cards, so it is a card game. I need to search Okey next. Action 2: search[Okey] Observation 2: Okey (Turkish pronunciation: [okej]) is a tile-based game.[1] The aim of the game is to score points against the opposing players by collecting certain groups of tiles. Okey is usually played with four players, but can also be played with only two or three players. It bears resemblance to the game Rummikub, as it is played with the same set of boards and tiles, but under a different set of rules.[1]. The game was derived from the original Rummikub after cultural contacts of Gastarbeiter in Germany.[citation needed] Okey is very popular in Turkey and among Turkish communities abroad.[1]. The 106 tiles are placed face down on the table and thoroughly mixed. ",

I should try searching for \"Home movie\" instead.\n Action 3: search[Home movie] Observation 3: A home movie is a short amateur film or video typically made just to preserve a visual record of family activities, a vacation, or a special event, and intended for viewing at home by family and friends. Originally, home movies were made on photographic film in formats that usually limited the movie-maker to about three minutes per roll of costly camera film. The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting silent film.. The 1970s saw the advent of consumer camcorders that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively inexpensive videocassette which also had audio and did not need to be developed the way film did. This was followed by digital video cameras that recorded to flash memory, and most recently smartphones with video recording capability, made the creation of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person..

However, without more information, I cannot determine the exact movie titled \"Home\" that the question is referring to. Therefore, I cannot answer whether \"Bangkok Girl\" and \"Home\" are both horror movies.\n Action 4: finish[I'm sorry, I don't have enough information to answer your question.]"

Dungeons are generally associated with medieval castles, though their association with torture probably derives more from the Renaissance period.[citation needed] An oubliette (from French oublier meaning to forget) or bottle dungeon is a basement room which is accessible only from a hatch or hole (an angstloch) in a high ceiling.. The word dungeon comes from French donjon (also spelled dongeon), which means \"keep\", the main tower of a castle. The first recorded instance of the word in English was near the beginning of the 14th century when it held the same meaning as donjon. The earlier meaning of \"keep\" is still in use for academics, although in popular culture, it has come to mean a cell or \"oubliette\".[citation needed] Though it is uncertain, both dungeon and donjon are thought to derive from the Middle Latin word dominus, meaning \"lord\" or \"master\".[1]. Thought 3: Wait, that's not right. The previous search result seems to have confused \"dungeons\" in the medieval sense with \"Dungeons & Dragons,\" the role-playing game.

Action 1: search[Talking Heads] Observation 1: Talking Heads were an American new wave band that formed in 1975 in New York City.[2] The band was composed of David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar),  Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s,\" Talking Heads helped to pioneer new wave music by combining elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with an anxious, clean-cut image.[6]. Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth met as freshmen at the Rhode Island School of Design, where Byrne and Frantz were part of a band called the Artistics.[1]: 24  The trio moved to New York City in 1975, adopted the name Talking Heads, joined the New York punk scene, and recruited Harrison to round out the band.. Their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, was released in 1977 to positive reviews.[8] They collaborated with the British producer Brian Eno on the acclaimed albums More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980), which blended their art school sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti.[6] From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.. Talking Heads reached their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Thought 2: Talking Heads formed in New York City.

Primarily instrumental, \"Man or Astro-man?\" blended the surf rock style of the early 1960s, like that of Dick Dale and The Spotnicks with the new wave and punk rock sounds of the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"Man or Astro-man?\" was known for their anachronistic dedication to science fiction themes, audio samples, obscure electronic devices (such as theremins and tesla coils), and high-energy live performances. Their earlier albums like Is It ... Man or Astroman? and Destroy All Astromen![1] were known for their traditional surf rock instrumentation and sci-fi sound bite song introductions, whereas their later albums like EEVIAC...

One possibility is that it was added to the National Heritage List for England, which is a register of all nationally protected heritage assets in England, including listed buildings.\n\nHowever, without more specific information, we can't be certain which register the church was added to.

In the early 1980s, he emigrated to the United States and wrote for The Nation and Vanity Fair. Known as \"one of the 'four horsemen'\" (along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett) of New Atheism, he gained prominence as a columnist and speaker.

Hitchens's political views evolved greatly throughout his life.[6] Originally describing himself as a democratic socialist,[7] he was a member of various socialist organisations in his early life, including the Trotskyist International Socialists.[8] He was critical of aspects of American foreign policy, including its involvement in Vietnam, Chile and East Timor.

It is the seventh theatrical film featuring the Muppets.[7] The film stars Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, as well as Muppet performers Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman, Matt Vogel, and Peter Linz. Bret McKenzie served as music supervisor, writing four of the film's five original songs, while Christophe Beck composed the score.[8] In the film, devoted Muppet fan Walter, his human brother Gary and Gary's girlfriend Mary help Kermit the Frog reunite the disbanded Muppets, as they must raise $10 million to save the Muppet Theater from Tex Richman, a greedy businessman who plans to demolish the theater to drill for oil.. Walt Disney Pictures first announced the film in March 2008, with Segel and Stoller as the screenwriters and Hoberman and Lieberman's Mandeville Films as co-producer.[2] Conceived by Disney to serve as a creative reboot of the franchise after years of relative dormancy following their acquisition of the Muppets in 2004, Segel and Stoller intently addressed the characters' recent real-world lack of public exposure in mainstream culture within the context of the film's plot. Though reports indicated Stoller would direct the film, Bobin was ultimately hired to direct in January 2010, and the film's supporting cast was filled out in October of the same year with the casting of Adams, Cooper and Jones.
